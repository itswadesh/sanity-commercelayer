## Getting started

The quickest way to get up and running is to go to https://www.sanity.io/create?template=commercelayer/sanity-template-commercelayer and create a new project by following the instructions on Sanity.

Alternatively, you can clone this repository, configure the starter, import the dataset into your Sanity studio, import some test data into your Commerce Layer organization, and deploy your application.

### ⚙️ Installation guide

1. Clone this repository ([learn how to do this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).

2. Rename the `/env.example` file to `.env` and add the following:

- Your project ID, dataset, and token from [manage.sanity.io](https://manage.sanity.io).
- Your client ID and client endpoint from [Commerce Layer](https://dashboard.commercelayer.io/sign_up).

3. Run the command below to install the necessary dependencies of your project:

```bash
npm install && cd /studio && sanity install
```

4. Add your `projectTitle`, `projectId,` and `dataset` in `/studio/sanity.json`.

5. Run the command below to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the frontend at `localhost:3000` and studio at `localhost:3333`.

### ⬇️ Import test studio content

> If you set up your project from the starters page on Sanity, you should skip this step as Sanity will automatically add the dataset's content.

1. Extract the `production.tar.gz` file in `/.sanity-template/data` directory using the command below:

```bash
tar -xf production.tar.gz
```

The extracted folder name should look like `production-export-2021-02-26t14-15-56-557z`.

2. Run the command below in `/studio` to import the `data.ndjson` file in the extracted folder.

```bash
sanity dataset import ../.sanity-template/data/<name of extracted folder>/data.ndjson <your_dataset>
```

3. Check the frontend and studio now to preview the imported content.

### ⬇️ Seed Commerce Layer data

1. Create a free [Commerce Layer account](https://dashboard.commercelayer.io/sign_up).

2. Create a new [organization](https://commercelayer.io/docs/data-model/users-and-organizations).

3. Create a new application in the **Integrations** tab with **Name** set to `<Project Name>`, and **Role** set to `admin`.

4. In your newly created application, copy your `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, and organization slug.

5. Install the [Commerce Layer CLI](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-cli) which is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercelayer/commercelayer-cli) using the command below:

```
// npm
npm install -g @commercelayer/cli

//yarn
yarn global add @commercelayer/cli
```

6. Log into your application via the CLI using the previously created CLI credentials like so:

```
commercelayer applications:login -o <organizationSlug> -i <clientId> -s <clientSecret> -a <applicationAlias>
```

7. Install the seeder plugin using the command below:

```
commercelayer plugins:install seeder
```

8. Run the command below to import a [set of products](https://data.commercelayer.app/seed/skus.json), related [prices](https://data.commercelayer.app/seed/prices.json), and [inventory](https://data.commercelayer.app/seed/stock_items.json) into your organization.
